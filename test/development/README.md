## About
This folder contains manually-initiated automated testing for use in development. These tests may be short, quick-running, custom scripts for use in
developmental testing prior to running pytest (e.g., to find basic mistakes like typos not caught by the linter). Or, they may be automated jupyter notebook tests
that rely on running time-intensive models and may take hours to run.
