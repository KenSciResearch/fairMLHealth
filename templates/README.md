## Binary Classification Assessment Template
Use [this template](Template-BinaryClassificationAssessment.ipynb) as a skeleton for comparing fairness and performance measures across a set of trained binary classification models. For an example with a completed comparison, see [examples_and_tutorials/Example-BinaryClassificationTemplate.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KenSciResearch/fairMLHealth/blob/reorg/examples_and_tutorials/Example-BinaryClassificationTemplate.ipynb)
