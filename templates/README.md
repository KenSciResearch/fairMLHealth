## [Binary Classification Assessment Template](Template-BinaryClassificationAssessment.ipynb)
Use this template as a skeleton for comparing fairness and performance measures across a set of trained binary classification models. For an example with a completed comparison, see [tutorials_and_examples/ Example-BinaryClassificationTemplate.ipynb]((https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KenSciResearch/fairMLHealth/blob/integration/tutorials_and_examples/Example-BinaryClassificationTemplate.ipynb)
