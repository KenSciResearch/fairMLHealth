    "**Please note: This notebook is intended as an introduction to and reference for evaluating the fairness of a set of machine learning models using FairMLHealth, and it is not designed to work with outside models.**  \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces concepts, methods, and libraries for measuring fairness in machine learning (ML) models as it relates to problems in healthcare. This is a revised version of the tutorial presented at the [KDD 2020 Tutorial on Fairness in Machine Learning for Healthcare](../docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-Slides.pdf), the notebook for which can be found here: [/docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-TutorialNotebook.ipynb](../docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-TutorialNotebook.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 1](#part1) will frame the problem and introduce our hypothetical example predicting Length of Stay (LOS) based on a subset of the [MIMIC-III clinical database](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/). In [Part 2](#part2) this baseline model is used as an example to evaluate and discuss common metrics like *Disparate Impact*, *Equalized Odds*, and *Consistency Scores*. Then, [Part 4] compares the results of the baseline model to results for other modeling approaches: one \"unaware\" version, a \"fairness-aware\" version, and a third version simply using a different standard machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are abundant other publications covering the theoretical basis for fairness metrics, with many online and academic resources covering the details of specific fairness measures (See [References (bottom)](#references) and [Additional Resources (bottom)](#additional_resources), or [Our Resources Page](../docs/resources/Measures_QuickReference.md)). Many of these excellent references fall short of discussing edge cases as well as the practical and philosophical considerations when evaluating real models for real customers. Here we attempt to bridge this gap.\n",

    "In issues of social justice, discrimination is the unjustified, differential treatment of individuals based on their sociodemographic status [[Romei and Ruggieri 2014]](#romei2014_ref).  A \"fair\" model is one that does not discriminate. Therefore, the goal of our work is to evaluate (a) whether our model makes similar predictions for all socially salient groups, or (b) whether any differences arise that are ethically justified.\n",

    "Three  metric categories are commonly used for determining whether a model is considered \"fair\": (1) Group Fairness, which compares the statistical similarities of predictions relative to known and discrete protected groupings; (2) Similarity-Based Measures, which evaluate predictions without those discrete protected groups; and (3) Causal Reasoning measures, which evaluate fairness through the use of causal models.\n",

    "Let's examine a model built for a hypothetical program providing early health and financial counseling to patients expected to experience a prolonged length of stay (LOS) in an intensive care unit (ICU) ward. The service is paid for by small donations from the community it serves. We have found that LOS for this program can be predicted with reasonable performance, and as contemporaries in the healthcare industry, we would like to ensure that resources are distributed among our patients fairly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our baseline model will use the patient's age, diagnosis, language, and the use of medical procedures during their stay to predict this value. Our model produces a binary prediction indicating whether or not the LOS for a given admission is greater than the mean. Observations have been dropped where LOS values are extremely large (30 days or greater) or negative (indicating that the patient was deceased upon arrival at the ICU).\n"

    "### Significance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally recommended to test whether any differences in model outcomes for protected attributes are the effect of a sampling error in our test. FairMLHealth comes with a bootstrapping utility and supporting functions that can be used in statistical testing. The bootstrapping feature accepts any function that returns a p-value and will return a True or False if the p-value is greater than some alpha for a threshold number of randomly sampled trials. Eamples using the bootstrap_significance tool with built-in test functions are shown below. The first test indicates that there is likely a statistically significant difference in the mean of length of stay between English speakers and Non-English speakers. However, per the second and third tests there is not evidence of a statistically significant difference in the distribution of prediction successes and failures (True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives), even when using a conservative threshold of 50% (i.e., at least 50% of trials must have a p-value less than alpha to indicate a difference). However, these tests are not comprehensive. For the purposes of the tutorial, we'll proceed as though we're convinced of a statistical difference.\n"

    "The table shows that relative fairness or unfairness of our predictions differs across the available measures, while model performance remains similar. Looking at the Disparate Impact Ratio, for example, we can see that the three altered model predictions have reduced values relative to our baseline. However and surprisingly, the Fair GridSearch result has so dramatically shifted the predictions that they are now *less* fair by this measure. While the baseline model has a 20% bias in favor of the *unprivileged* group, the fairness-aware model has nearly a 40% bias favoring the *privileged* group. \n",

    "Similar results are not always the case. The GridSearch algorithm available in Fairlearn has been shown to be effective on some datasets ([Agarwal *et al.* (2019)](#Agarwal2019)). And unawareness does not always reduce Disparate Impact; in fact it can increase it, as we showed in the [KDD 2020 Tutorial](../docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-TutorialNotebook.ipynb) which compared fairness relative to gender using this same general setup. This goes to say that the field has not yet found a panacea which can correct all fairness issues for every model.\n"

    "Although our newer model versions create predictions that are more fair by measure of Disparate Impact, by other measures, such as the Balanced Accuracy Scores or Consistency Scores, our these neweer model predictions may actually be less fair. As discussed above, although two of the ratio measures (Disparate Impact Ratio and Equalized Odds Ratio) are outside of the \"fair\" range for our baseline predictions, the the acutal differences in the rates which those ratios are comparing are very small. Moreover, although the Consistency Score value is also outside of the fair range, we have shown that the measure may be invalid for this particular dataset. Additional work is needed to define and support a valid measure of similarity if we are to use this type of score. Thus, these results indicate that our model meets the minimum threshold for group fairness **according to the measures available and according to the groups that we've defined**. This is a good start.\n",

    "Clearly there is still room for improvement, particularly since we easily developed two other models that are generally farther within range and with comparable results. We will have to consult the values of our stakeholders to know if the tradeoffs of these two other models are worth the gains. Moreover, we should not stop simply with the English language. Although the larger group of \"Non-English speakers\" may get predictions within the fair range, it's still worth investigating whether there are other language subgroups for whom the model performance fails. And if there are any other proxy variables in the data, we will want to investigate those as well. We also must evaluate fairness relative to other protected attributes, such as gender (see [Example 2](#example2)) and age."

    "Just as data and model performance can change over time (for example, in concept drift), so too can prediction fairness. We recommend integrating fairness evaluation with your modeling pipeline as a form of continuous process improvement. By regularly evaluating multiple measures of fairness at once, you can ensure that it continues to meet stakeholders' expectations.\n",
