# # Practical Measurement of Fairness in Classifcation Tasks for Healthcare
# ----

# ## Overview
# This tutorial introduces methods and libraries for measuring fairness in machine learning models as it relates to problems in healthcare, presented in conjunction with the [KDD 2020 Tutorial on Fairness in Machine Learning for Healthcare](https://github.com/KenSciResearch/fairMLHealth/blob/master/publications/FairnessInHealthcareML-KDD-2020.pptx). Through the this noebook you will first learn basic background about fairness metrics", before generating a simple baseline model predicting Length of Stay (LOS) using data from the [MIMIC-III database](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/). This baseline model will be used as an example to understand common measures like *Disparate Impact Ratios* and *Consistency Scores*. Through this notebook you will gain a familiarity with the Scikit-Learn-compatible tools available in [AIF360](http://aif360.mybluemix.net/) and [FairLearn](https://fairlearn.github.io/), two of the most comprehensive and flexible Python libraries for measuring and addressing bias in machine learning models.

# # Part 0 - Metrics of Fairness <a class="anchor" id="part0"></a>
# Here we provide some brief context for the evaluation of fairness in machine learning. For more information, see the [KDD 2020 Tutorial on Fairness in Machine Learning for Healthcare](https://github.com/KenSciResearch/fairMLHealth/blob/master/publications/FairnessInHealthcareML-KDD-2020.pptx).
# 
# ## What is a "Fair" Model
# In the context of this tutorial, a "fair" model is one that imposes no discrimination - the unjustified differential treatment of individuals based on their demographic status. [Romei and Ruggieri (2014)](#romei2014_ref) We refer to these "socially salient" groups ([Speicher 2018](#speicher2018_ref)) as ***protected attributes***, aka. *sensitive attributes* or *protected features*. There are six common metrics for determining whether a given machine learning model meets this definition: Equal Treatment ("Unawareness"), Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Predictive Parity, Individual Fairness, and Counterfactual Fairness. Basic definitions for each of these metrics are provided for you in the [Quick Reference](#metric_quickref) below. 
# 
# ## Disparate Treatment vs Disparate Impact <a id="disparateimpact"></a>
# Discussions of discrimination often evoke direct, typically deliberate action to disadvantage one race, religion, or ethnicity. Such explicit action is often referred to as *disparate treatment*. However, a more insidious form of discrimination emerges from ostensibly unbiased practices that result (often unwittingly) in the unfair treatment of a socially disadvantaged group. In machine learning models, such *disparate impact* can emerge, for example, from unconscious collection biases or undetected historical biases in the data. Disparate impact in machine learning can lead either to immediate disparity in model predictions or to a longer-term discrepancy through unconscious human biases in its application. This tutorial focuses on measures to detect the former. However, if you are interested in the latter, we reccomend looking at the [Fairness Indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/fairness_indicators) suite released by a team at Google.

# ##  Fairness Metrics Quick Reference <a id="metric_quickref"></a>
# | Metric | Defintion | Weakness | References |
# |:------|:------|:------|:------|
# |**Unawareness** | A model is unaware if the protected attribute is not used. | Removal of a protected attribute may be ineffectual due to the presence of proxy features highly correlated with the protected attribute.| [Zemel *et al* (2013)](#zemel2013_ref), [Barocas and Selbst (2016)](#barocas2016_ref) |
# |**Demographic Parity**| A model has **Demographic Parity** if the predicted positve rates (selection rates) are approximately the same for all protected attribute groups.<br> $$\dfrac{P(\hat{y}=1 \lvert unprivileged)} {P(\hat{y}=1 \rvert privileged)}$$ | Historical biases present in the data are not addressed and may still bias the model. | [Zafar *et al* (2017)](#zafar2017_ref) |
# |**Equalized Odds**| Odds are equalized if $P(+)$ is approximately the same for all protected attribute groups.<br>  **Equal Opportunity** is a special case of equalized odds specifying that $$P(+ \rvert y=1)$$ is approximately the same across groups. | Historical biases present in the data  are not addressed and may still bias the model. | [Hardt *et al* (2016)](#hardt2016_ref) |
# |**Predictive Parity**| **Predictive Parity** exists where the Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value are each approximately the same for all protected attribute groups. | Historical biases present in the data are not addressed and may still bias the model.  | [Zafar *et al* (2017)](#zafar2017_ref) |
# |**Individual Fairness**| Individual fairness exists if "similar" individuals (ignoring the protected attribute) are likely to have similar predictions. | The appropriate metric for similarity may be ambiguous. |[Dwork (2012)](#dwork2012_ref), [Zemel (2013)](#zemel2013_ref), [Kim *et al* (2018)](#kim2018_ref) |
# |**Counterfactual Fairness****| Counterfactual fairness exists where counterfactual replacement of the protected attribute does not significantly alter predictive performance. This counterfactual change must be propogated to correlated variables. | It may be intractable to develop a counterfactual model.  | [Russell *et al* (2017)](#russell2017_ref) |
# 
# \** *Note that this tutorial will not elaborate the details of Counterfactual Fairness since the libraries used do not have built-in functionality for it. For an example of Counterfactual Fairness, see "ThemisML" by [Bantilan (2018)](#bantilan2018_ref).*

# ## Loading MIMIC III Data
# As mentioned above, the MIMIC-III data download contains a folder of zipped_files. The tutorial code in the [Data Subset](#datasubset) section below will automatically unzip and format all necessary data for these experiments, saving the formatted data in the same MIMIC folder. Simply enter the correct path of the MIMIC folder in the following cell to enable this feature. Your path should end with the directory "MIMIC".
# 
# Example: path_to_mimic_data_folder = "~/data/MIMIC"

# In[2]:


# path_to_mimic_data_folder = "[path to your downloaded data folder]"
path_to_mimic_data_folder = "~/data/MIMIC"


# ## Data Subset <a id="datasubset"></a>
# Example models in this notebook use data from all years of the MIMIC-III dataset for patients aged 65 and older. Data are imported at the encounter level with all additional patient identification dropped. All models include an "AGE" feature, simplified to 5-year bins, as well as boolean diagnosis and procedure features categorized through the Clinical Classifications Software system ([HCUP](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp)). All features other than age are one-hot encoded and prefixed with their variable type (e.g. "GENDER_", "ETHNICITY_").  

# In[3]:


df = helpers.load_example_data(path_to_mimic_data_folder) 
df = df.loc[df['AGE'].ge(65),:]
helpers.print_feature_table(df)
display(Markdown('---'))
display(df.head())


# ## Baseline Length of Stay Model
# The example models in this tutorial predict the total length of time spent in an ICU ward for a given hospital admission, a.k.a. the "Length of Stay" (LOS). The baseline model will use only the patient's age, their diagnosis, and the use of medical procedures during their stay to predict this value. 
# 
# Two target variables will be used in the following experiments: 'length_of_stay' and 'long_los'. The length_of_stay target contains the true value in days for the patient's stay in ICU. The long_los target is a binary variable indicating whether or not the length_of_stay for a given admission is greater than the mean. Observations have been dropped where LOS values are extremely long (30 days or greater) or negative (indicating that the patient was deceased upon arrival at the ICU). We will generate variable below, then generate our baseline model.

# In[4]:


# Generate a binary target flagging whether an observation's length_of_stay value is above or below the mean. 
mean_val=df['length_of_stay'].mean()
df['long_los'] = df['length_of_stay'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > mean_val else 0)
los_tbl = df[['length_of_stay', 'long_los']].describe().transpose().round(4)
display(los_tbl.style.applymap(helpers.highlight_col, subset=pd.IndexSlice[:, 'mean']))

# Display LOS distributions
display(Markdown('---'))
ax = df['length_of_stay'].plot(kind='kde', title="Probability Density of Length of Stay")
ax.set_xlabel("Length of Stay in Days")
plt.show()


# In[5]:


# Subset and Split Data
X = df.loc[:,[c for c in df.columns if (c.startswith('AGE') or c.startswith('DIAGNOSIS_') or c.startswith('PROCEDURE_'))]]
y = df.loc[:, ['long_los']]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# Set model parameters (defined here for consistency throughout models)
xgb_params = {'colsample_bytree': 1.0, 'gamma': 2, 'learning_rate': 0.05, 'max_depth': 5, 
                'min_child_weight': 1,  'n_estimators': 600, 'subsample': 0.6}

# Train Model
baseline_model = XGBClassifier(**xgb_params)
baseline_model.fit(X_train, y_train.iloc[:,0])
y_pred_baseline = baseline_model.predict(X_test)
y_prob_baseline = baseline_model.predict_proba(X_test)

# ## Testing Gender as a Protected Attribute
# Our first experiment will test the effect of including the protected attribute 'GENDER_M'. This attribute is encoded in our data as a boolean attribute, where 0=female and 1=male. Males are assumed to be the privileged group. For the purposes of this experiment no other senstitive attributes or potential proxies will be used, such that only gender, age, diangosis, and procedure codes will be used to make the prediction.
# 
# First we will examine fairness measurements for a version of this model that includes gender as a feature, before comparing them to similar measurements for the baseline (without gender). We will see that while some measures can be used to analyze a model in isolation, others (e.g. **Unawareness**) require comparison against other models to clearly demonstrate a model's fairness/unfairness.

# In[6]:


# Show LOS Distribtuion Relative to GENDER_M
is_male = df['GENDER_M'].eq(1)
gender_tbl = df.groupby('GENDER_M')['length_of_stay'].describe().round(4)

y_pred_gender = gender_model.predict(X_test_gender)
y_prob_gender = gender_model.predict_proba(X_test_gender)

print("\n", "Prediction Scores for Model with Gender Included:", "\n",

# # Part 2 - Measuring Fairness with AIF360 <a class="anchor" id="part2"></a>
# ## Getting Started

# In[8]:


# Load AIF360 Measures
from aif360.sklearn.metrics import (
    base_rate, selection_rate,
    statistical_parity_difference, disparate_impact_ratio,
    average_odds_difference, average_odds_error, equal_opportunity_difference,
    difference, ratio,
    consistency_score, generalized_entropy_index, theil_index, generalized_entropy_error, between_group_generalized_entropy_error
)


# ### Statistical Functions of Note
# AIF360 has built-in statistical functions that do not measure fairness but may be of use for providing context.
# 
# The *Base Rate* returns the average value of the ground truth (optionally weighted). It provides useful context, although it is not technically a measure of fairness. 
# > $base\_rate = \sum_{i=0}^N(y_i)/N$
# 
# The *Selection Rate* returns the average predicted value. For a binary prediction problem it equates to the probability of prediction for the positive class ("the probability of selection").
# > $selection\_rate = \sum_{i=0}^N(\hat{y}_i)/N$

# In[9]:


# Demonstrate that the Base Rate and Selection Rate
print(bold_mgta+"Prediction Rates"+clr_off)
print(bold_on + "Base Rate = " + clr_off, 
          base_rate(y_test)
     )
print(bold_on + 'Overall Selection Rate ='+clr_off, 
          selection_rate(y_test, y_pred_gender)
     ) 


# ### Formatting AIF360 Inputs
# AIF360 requires the protected attribute(s) to be the index of the dataframes (or 2-D arrays) containing the ground truth and the prediction targets. For our walkthrough of the different measures we will add that formatting in the cell below. Note that Dataframes that have been formatted for the AIF360 Scikit API will be given the suffix "_aif".

# In[10]:


# Generate target dataframes specifically formatted as inputs for AIF360
y_test_aif = pd.concat([X_test_gender['GENDER_M'], y_test], axis=1).set_index('GENDER_M')
y_pred_aif = pd.concat([X_test_gender['GENDER_M'].reset_index(drop=True), pd.Series(y_pred_gender)], axis=1).set_index('GENDER_M')
y_pred_aif.columns = y_test_aif.columns
print(bold_on + "AIF360 formatting added." + clr_off)


# ----
# # Measures of Fairness in AIF360
# | Metric | Measures Covered |
# |:----|:----|
# |**Unawareness**| *Measured through model comparison using other metrics of fairness.* |
# |**Demographic Parity**| Disparate Impact Ratio, Statistical Parity Difference|
# |**Equalized Odds**| Average Odds Difference, Equal Odds Ratio, Equal Odds Error|
# |**Predictive Parity**| (Positive) Predictive Parity Difference|
# |**Individual Fairness**| Consistency Score, Between-Group Generalized Entropy Error|
# |**Counterfactual Fairness****| *Counterfactual fairness is not covered in this tutorial.* |
#  
#  

# ## Measures of Fairness by Group
# Measures to determine if results are similar for between groups.

# ### Demographic Parity <a id="aif360_dp"></a>
# A model has **Demographic Parity** if the predicted positve rates (selection rates) are approximately the same for all protected attribute groups. Two common measures are the Statistical Parity Difference and the Disparate Impact Ratio.
# 
# The *Statistical Parity Difference* is the difference in the probability of prediction between the two groups. A difference of 0 indicates that the model is perfectly fair relative to the protected attribute (it favors neither the privileged nor the unprivileged group). Values between -0.1 and 0.1 are considered reasonably fair. 
# > $statistical\_parity\_difference = P(\hat{y}=1\ |\ unprivileged) - P(\hat{y}=1\ |\ privileged) $
# 
# The *Disparate Impact Ratio* is the ratio between the probability of positive prediction for the unprivileged group and the probability of positive prediction for the privileged group. A ratio of 1 indicates that the model is fair relative to the protected attribute (it favors neither the privileged nor the unprivileged group).  Values between 0.8 and 1.2 are considered reasonably fair. 
# > $disparate\_impact\_ratio = \dfrac{P(\hat{y}=1\ |\ unprivileged)}{P(\hat{y} =1\ |\ privileged)} = \dfrac{selection\_rate(\hat{y}_{unprivileged})}{selection\_rate(\hat{y}_{privileged})}$
# 

# In[11]:

      disparate_impact_ratio(y_test_aif, y_pred_aif, prot_attr='GENDER_M')
     )
print()


# ### Equal Odds <a id="aif360_eo"></a>
# Odds are equalized if P(+) is approximately the same for all protected attribute groups. For all of these measures, a difference of 0 indicates that the model is perfectly fair relative to the protected attribute. Values between -0.1 and 0.1 are considered reasonably fair.
# 
# *Average Odds Difference* measures the average of the difference in False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) for the unprivileged and privileged groups. 
# > $ average\_odds\_difference = \dfrac{(FPR_{unprivileged} - FPR_{privileged}) + (TPR_{unprivileged} - TPR_{privileged})}{2}$
# 
# *Average Odds Error* is the average of the absolute difference in FPR and TPR for the unprivileged and privileged groups. 
# > $average\_odds\_error = \dfrac{|FPR_{unprivileged} - FPR_{privileged}| + |TPR_{unprivileged} - TPR_{privileged}|}{2}$
#         
# *Equal Opportunity Difference* is the difference in recall scores (TPR) between the unprivileged and privileged groups. 
# > $equal\_opportunity\_difference =  recall(\hat{y}_{unprivileged}) - recall(\hat{y}_{privileged})$
# 

# In[12]:

       equal_opportunity_difference(y_test_aif, y_pred_aif, prot_attr='GENDER_M')
     )
print()


# ### Predictive Rate Parity and Disparate Performance
# **Predictive Parity** exists where the Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value are each approximately the same for all protected attribute groups.
# 
# The *Positive Predictive Paritiy Difference* is the difference in Positive Predictive Value (PPV), aka. the precision. 
# > $positive\_predictive\_parity\_difference =  precision(\hat{y}_{unprivileged}) - precision(\hat{y}_{privileged})$
# 
# <a id='aif_difference_func'></a>
# Although neither of the libraries in this tutorial have a specific function for measuring **Predictive Parity**, both libraries do include features for calculaing custom, between-group differences in performance. In AIF360, this is facilitated by a flexible "difference" method that accepts an arbitrary scoring function as an argument. AIF360 also contains a "ratio" function of similar purpose. Here we will use difference() and ratio() to calculate  positive predictive parity difference for the GENDER_M model, in addition to several different custom metrics.

# ## Measures of Fairness by Individual
# Measures of individual fairness determine if "similar" individuals (ignoring the protected attribute) are likely to have similar predictions.
# 
# ### Consistency Scores <a id="consistency_score"></a>
# Consistency scores are measure the similarity between specific predictions and the predictions of like individuals. They are not specific to a particular attribute, but rather they evaluate the generally equal treatment of equal individuals. In AIF360, the Consistency Score is calculated as the compliment of the mean distance to the score of the mean nearest neighbhor, using Scikit's Nearest Neighbors algorithm (default: 5 neighbors determined by BallTree algorithm). For this measure, values closer to 1 indicate greater consistency, and those closer to zero indicate less consistency. More information about consistency scores is available in [Zemel (2013)](#zemel2013_ref).
# > $ consistency\_score = 1 - \frac{1}{n\cdot\text{n_neighbors}}\sum_{i=1}^n |\hat{y}_i - \sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}_{\text{n_neighbors}}(x_i)} \hat{y}_j| $

# ### The Generalized Entropy Index and Related Measures
# The *Generalized Entropy (GE) Index* was proposed as a metric for income inequality ([Shorrocks 1980](#shorrocks_ref)), although it originated as a measure of redundancy in information theory. In 2018, [Speicher *et al*](#speicher2018_ref) proposed its use for Machine Learning models. These measures are dimensionless, and therefore are most useful in comparison relative to each other. Values closer to zero indicate greater fairness, and increasing values indicating decreased fairness.
# > $ GE = \mathcal{E}(\alpha) = \begin{cases}
#             \frac{1}{n \alpha (\alpha-1)}\sum_{i=1}^n\left[\left(\frac{b_i}{\mu}\right)^\alpha - 1\right],& \alpha \ne 0, 1,\\
#             \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{b_{i}}{\mu}\ln\frac{b_{i}}{\mu},& \alpha=1,\\
#             -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\ln\frac{b_{i}}{\mu},& \alpha=0.
#         \end{cases}
#         $
#         
# #### Special Cases      
# The *Theil Index* occurs where the $GE$ alpha is equal to one. Although it is dimensionless like other indices of generalized entropy, it can be transformed into an Atkinson index, which has a range between 0 and 1.
# > $ Theil Index = GE(\alpha = 1) $
# 
# The *Coefficient of Variation* is is two times the square root of the $GE$ where alpha is equal to 2.
# > $ Coefficient of Variation = 2*\sqrt{GE(\alpha = 2)} $
# 
# #### Generalized Entropy of Error
# *Generalized Entropy Error* is the Generalized Entropy Index of the prediction error. Like the consistency_score above, this measure is dimensionless; however, it does not provide specific information to allow discernment between groups.
# > $ GE(Error, \alpha = 2) = GE(\hat{y}_i - y_i + 1) $
# 
# *Between Group Generalized Entropy Error* is the Generalized Entropy Index for the weighted means of group-specific errors. More information is available in [Speicher (2013)](#speicher2018_ref).
# > $ GE(Error_{group}, \alpha = 2) =  GE( [N_{unprivileged}*mean(Error_{unprivileged}), N_{privileged}*mean(Error_{privileged})] ) $

# # Part 3 - Comparing Two Models  <a class="anchor" id="part3"></a>
# ### Evaluating Unawareness 
# A model is unaware relative to a protected attribute so long as that attribute is not included in the model. 
# 
# To facilitate comparison between our GENDER_M-inclusive model and the baseline, this tutorial includes a helper function which returns all of the previously seen measures in a convenient pandas dataframe. This function will be used to save space for the remainder of the tutorial. 
# 
# Below we generate a table conatining fairness scores for our LOS models. The scores we just generated are constrasted against gender-relative scores for the baseline model, which importantly does not contain GENDER_M as an attribute. As the table shows, removal of the gender attribute produces little change in measure values. 

# In[31]:


#
gender_values = X_test_gender[['GENDER_M']]

# Use Tutorial Helper Function to Generate Dataframe of Measure Values for Gender-Included Model, Relative to Patient Gender
gender_scores = model_comparison.report_classification_fairness(X_test_gender, gender_values, y_test, y_pred_gender, y_prob_gender[:,1])

# Use Tutorial Helper Function to Generate Dataframe of Measure Values for Baseline Model, Relative to Patient Gender
baseline_scores = model_comparison.report_classification_fairness(X_test, gender_values, y_test, y_pred_baseline, y_prob_baseline[:,1])

# Merge Results to Compare Values
comparison = gender_scores.rename(columns={'Value':'Gender Fairness (GENDER_M Included)'}
                                ).merge(baseline_scores.rename(columns={'Value':'Gender Fairness, Baseline (GENDER_M Excluded)'}))

# Highlight Groups differentially
im_loc = comparison[comparison['Measure'].eq('** Individual Fairness **')].index[0]
grp_measures = comparison.loc[(comparison.index < im_loc), 'Measure'].tolist()
comparison.style.set_caption('Fairness Measures Relative to Gender for Gender-Inclusive Model vs Baseline'     
               ).apply(helpers.highlight_row, colname='Measure', h_type='text', values=grp_measures, color='slateblue', axis=1
               ).apply(helpers.highlight_row, colname='Measure', 
                       values=['Disparate Impact Ratio', 'Consistency Score'], axis=1
               )


# ### Evaluating Significance: The Four-Fifths Rule 
# As shown in the table above, the baseline model had slightly greater model performance, and by some measures indicate that this model has lesser disparity than the gender-inclusive model. However, the baseline model is also measured to have slightly **increased** disparity by other metrics. For example, the Statistical Parity Difference, Disparate Impact Ratio, and Average Odds Difference values are all slightly higher for the baseline model than for the GENDER_M-included model. How do we determine if this change is significant?
# 
# In 1978, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopted the "four-fifths rule", a guideline stating that, "A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded... as evidence of adverse impact." [EOC (1978)](#fourfifths_ref) This rubric has since been adopted for measures of fairness in machine learning.
# 
# The Disparate Impact Ratios shown in the table above can be used as an example of this rule. A model whose Disparate Impact Ratio is 1 is considered to be perfectly "fair" relative to the protected attribute in question. Since neither model in this example has a Disparate Impact Ratio greater than or equal to 1.2 (or <= 0.8), we can say that neither model imposes a significantly disparate impact with respect to gender according to the **[Demographic Parity](#metric_quickref)** metric. Although, as will be clear in the next example, "fairness" by one measure does not necessarily mean that a model imposes no disparate impact.
# 
# In terms of **[Individual Fairness](#metric_quickref)**, the Consistency Score for gender-inclusive model prediction is slightly less higher than that of the baseline model. This may indicate that the gender-inclusive model is able to discern gender-associated medical nuance, differing efficacy in gender-associated treatments. Hence, we can hypothesize that the gender-inclusive model is actually more consistent, although additional work will be needed to understand the care pattern prove and disprove the hypothesis. 
# 
# Also note that since these measure values apply to only one split of these data, we have not yet accounted for the effect of randomness.
#

# # Part 4 - Testing Other Protected Attributes
# 
# ## English Language as a Protected Attribute <a id="engldist"></a>
# Our next experiment will test the presence of bias relative to a patient\'s language. Here we assume that individuals who speak English may be given preferential treatment in an English-speaking society due to the requirement of using a translator. In addition to being a protected attribute in its own right, language may also be a proxy for race or religion. As above, we will generate a boolean 'LANGUAGE_ENGL' feature to the baseline data.
# 

# In[32]:


# Update Split Data to Include Language as a Feature
lang_cols = [c for c in df.columns if c.startswith("LANGUAGE_")]
eng_cols = ['LANGUAGE_ENGL']
X_lang =  df.loc[:,lang_cols]

X_lang.loc[english_speaking, 'LANG_ENGL'] = 1

X_lang = X_lang.drop(lang_cols, axis=1).fillna(0)

# Show LOS Statistics Relative to LANG_ENGL

lang_values = X_test_lang['LANG_ENGL']

# Generate Dataframe of Measure Values for Baseline Model, Relative to Patient Language

# Merge Results to Display a Full Comparison
lang_comparison = lang_scores.rename(columns={'Value':'Language Fairness'}
                            ).merge(lang_ko_scores.rename(columns={'Value':'Language Fairness, Baseline (attribute absent)'})
                            )

lang_comparison.style.set_caption('Fairness Measures Relative to Language for Language-Inclusive Model vs Baseline'
                    ).apply(helpers.highlight_row, colname='Measure', h_type='text', values=grp_measures, color='slateblue', axis=1
                    ).apply(helpers.highlight_row, colname='Measure', 
                       values=['Disparate Impact Ratio', 'Consistency Score'], axis=1)


# ## Evaluating Justification
# The table above presents the measure values for the two LANG_ENGL-respective models. Although both models appear to be relatively fair by most group-fairness measures, by applying the four-fifths rule it is clear that the Disparate Impact Ratio of the LANG_ENGL-inclusive model shows evidence of disparate impact. Notice that this discrepancy is not clear from the Statistical Parity Difference, which is also a measure for the **Disparate Impact**. In this case the model "favors" the unprivileged class (those who do not speak English), which translates to a longer predicted LOS for those who do not speak English. Even the baseline model, although its Disparate Impact Ratio is within the four-fiths guideline, still shows evidence of some "favortism" toward the non-English speaking group. Does this constitute discrimination? As we noted [above](#disparateimpact), discrimination exists where differential treatment is unjustified.
# 
# As shown in the distribution figures [above](#engldist), there *is* a slight difference in the mean values of the English-speaking and non-English speaking groups. Because of this, we may be inclined to believe that the ICU in question could have difficulty in assessing non-English speaking patients due to important information being lost in translation. However, the independent t-test ([above](#engldist)) shows that this difference in means is not statistically significant, so we should not expect a significant difference in the probability of the positive class for either the English-speaking or the non-English speaking group. Hence, the bias induced by the inclusion of LANG_ENGL in our model is not reflective of a real phenomenon. In this case, because there is both evidence of disparate impact and a lack of statistical justification for including the feature, inclusion of LANG_ENGL in our model could be considered discriminatory. However, a lack of statistical justification is not necessary to conclude that the LANG_ENGL model is discriminatory. There could be a historical precedent of non-English speaking bias in the data that has since been addressed; or, LANG_ENGL may be esoterically related to certain diseases, such that it's inclusion makes the model more predictive through its interactions with other features. Neither of these rationale are likely still to be strong enough to justify the inclusion of LANG_ENGL without supporting medical or epidemiological evidence.

# # Part 5 - Comparing AIF360 and FairLearn <a class="anchor" id="part5"></a>
# 
# The FairLearn and AIF360 APIs for Scikit and XGBOOST models are very similar in user experience, and contain a similar set of measures as shown in the table below. Although the set of measures provided by AIF360 is more comprehensive, FairLearn does provide some measures that are unique. First we'll look at FairLearn measures that are also found in AIF360 before explaining the measures that are distinct. 

# In[35]:


# Load FairLearn Measures

# 

# ## Comparable Measures
# ### Demographic Parity
# The measures of demographic parity that exist in FairLearn are similar to the Statistical Parity Difference and Disparate Impact Ratio [found in AIF360](#aif360_dp). However, the FairLearn measures are defined such that their values are irrespective of which rate belongs to the privileged group. Through this definition, values are always in the range of 0 to 1, where 0 is perfectly fair for the parity difference and 1 is perfectly fair for the parity ratio. 
# 
# *Demographic Parity Difference* is the difference between the group rate with the maximum expected value and the group rate with the minimum expected value.
# > $ demographic\_parity\_difference = (\max_a \mathbb{E}[h(X)\ |\ A=a]) - (\min_a \mathbb{E}[h(X)\ |\ A=a])$
# 
# Although the *Demographic Parity Ratio* is defined s
# > $ demographic\_parity\_ratio = \dfrac{\min_a \mathbb{E}[h(X)\ |\ A=a]}{\max_a \mathbb{E}[h(X)\ |\ A=a]}$
# 
# ### Equal Odds
# Measures of Equal Odds in FairLearn are again similar to the [Equal Odds measures [available in AIF360](#aif360_eo). 
# 
# The *Equalized Odds Difference* is the greater between the difference in TPR and the difference in FPR. This provides a comparable measure to the Average Odds Difference found in AIF360. A value of 0 indicates that all groups have the same TPR, FPR, TNR, and FNR, and that the model is "fair" relative to the protected attribute. 
# > $ equalized\_odds\_difference = max( (FPR_{unprivileged} - FPR_{privileged}), (TPR_{unprivileged} - TPR_{privileged}) )$
# 
# 
# The *Equalized Odds Ratio* is the smaller between the TPR Ratio and FPR Ratio, where the ratios are defined as the ratio of the smaller of the between-group rates vs the larger of the between-group rates. A value of 1 means that all groups have the same TPR, FPR, TNR, and FNR. This measure is comparable to the Equal Opportunity Difference (found in AIF360).
# > $ equalized\_odds\_ratio = min( \dfrac{FPR_{smaller}}{FPR_{larger}}, \dfrac{TPR_{smaller}}{TPR_{larger}} )$

# ## Group Summaries
# Similar to AIF360's "difference", which we used [above](#aif_difference_func) to calculate differences in prediction scores, FairLearn provides a "group_summary" function that returns a dictionary with both the overall and the between-group scores for a predictive metric. Also available are convenient wrappers, such as the "balanced_accuracy_score_group_summary" shown below which returns a summary of the balanced accuracy scores.
# 
# To extend the summary functionality, FairLearn also offers a "difference_from_summary" function (shown below), which calculates the between-group prediction difference (again, as we calculated [above](#aif_difference_func)). However, this function requres a dictionary input as returned by the specific group_summary mentioned above.

# In[37]:


print(bold_mgta+"Group Summary and Summary Difference Examples"+clr_off)
balanced_accuracy_summary = balanced_accuracy_score_group_summary(y_test, y_pred_lang, sensitive_features=X_test_lang['LANG_ENGL'])
print("Balanced Accuracy Summary", balanced_accuracy_summary )
print("Between-Group Balanced Accuracy Difference", difference_from_summary(balanced_accuracy_summary) )

# # Conclusion
# This tutorial introduced multiple measures of ML fairness in the context of a healthcare model using Scikit-compatible APIs from the AIF360 and FairLearn Python libraries. It discussed the four-fifths rule for evaluating the significance of fairness measures, and demonstrated the value of comparing multiple measures against each other both for a single model and across multiple models. Through the tutorial you considered reasonable justification for the inclusion of protected attributes within a machine learning model. And finally, you saw the similarity between the APIs for AIF360 and FairLearn. The knowledge gained from this tutorial can be applied to better-understand the effects of unfairness-mitigating algorithms, many of which are available in AIF360 and FairLearn as shown in the [table below](#mitigation).
