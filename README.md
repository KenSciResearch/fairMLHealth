# fairMLHealth
Tools and tutorials for evaluation of fairness and bias in healthcare applications of machine learning models.


## Organization
This library is constructed in three main parts:
- ### [Tools (fairmlhealth)](fairmlhealth/README.md)
    - Methods for generating fairness comparison tables
    - Features used by templates and tutorials to facilitate comparison of multiple metrics

- ### [Templates](templates/README.md)
    - Quickstart notebooks that serve as skeletons for your model analysis

- ### [Tutorias and Examples](tutorials_and_examples/README.md)
    - Tutorials for measuring and analyzing fairness as it applies to machine learning
    - Examples for using the templates and tools

- ### [Publications](docs/publications/README.md)
    - Tutorial presentations, papers, press releases


## Installation
Installing directly from GitHub:

    python -m pip install git+https://https://github.com/KenSciResearch/fairMLHealth

Installing from a local copy of the repo:

    pip install <path_to_fairMLHealth_dir>


## Usage
### Model Comparison Tool
The primary feature of this library is the model comparison tool. The current version supports assessment of binary prediction models through use of the compare_measures function.

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from fairmlhealth import model_comparison as fhmc

# Load data
X = pd.DataFrame({'col1':[1,2,50,3,45,32], 'col2':[34,26,44,2,1,1],
                  'col3':[32,23,34,22,65,27], 'gender':[0,1,0,1,1,0]})
y = pd.DataFrame({'y':[1,0,0,1,0,1]})
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.75, random_state=36)

#Train models
model_1 = BernoulliNB().fit(X_train, y_train)
model_2 = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)

# Deterimine your set of protected attributes
prtc_attr = X_test['gender']

# Specify either a dict or a list of trained models to compare
model_dict = {'model_1': model_1, 'model_2': model_2}

# Pass the above to the compare models function
fhmc.compare_measures(X_test, y_test, prtc_attr, model_dict)
```

Below is an example output for a set of linear models compared to fairness-aware alternate versions of those same models. Notice that three of the models do not produce prediction probabilities, and that the tool simply adds a NaN value for any measures relying on those probabilities.

### Reporting
There are also several useful reporting features, for example the comparison highlighting tool shown below.

```python
from fairmlhealth import model_comparison as fhmc, reports
# Load data and generate models

## < load data and generate models as per example above >

# Pass the data and models to the compare models function, as above
lin_comp = fhmc.compare_measures(X_test, y_test, prtc_attr, linear_models)
# Add highlights
reports.flag_suspicious(lin_comp)
```
