    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces concepts, methods, and libraries for measuring fairness in machine learning models as it relates to problems in healthcare. Through the this noebook you will first learn basic background about fairness metrics\", before generating a simple baseline model predicting Length of Stay (LOS) using data from the [MIMIC-III clinical database](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/). This baseline model will be used as an example to understand common measures like *Disparate Impact Ratios* and *Consistency Scores*. Through this notebook you will gain a familiarity with the Scikit-Learn-compatible tools available in [AIF360](http://aif360.mybluemix.net/) and [FairLearn](https://fairlearn.github.io/), two of the most comprehensive and flexible Python libraries for measuring and addressing bias in machine learning models."

    "## \"Fair\" Models\n",
    "In issues of social justice, discrimination is the unjustified, differential treatment of individuals based on their sociodemographic status. [[Romei and Ruggieri (2014)]](#romei2014_ref)  A \"fair\" model, in this case, is one that does not discriminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"socially salient\" sociodemographic groups ([[Speicher 2018]](#speicher2018_ref)) about which discrimination is measured are known as ***protected attributes***, also known as *sensitive attributes* or *protected features*. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are six common metrics for determining whether a machine learning model is considered \"fair\": Equal Treatment (\"Unawareness\"), Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Predictive Parity, Individual Fairness, and Counterfactual Fairness. Basic definitions for each of these metrics are provided for you in the [Quick Reference](#metric_quickref) below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Fairness  <a id = \"disparateimpact\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"discrimination\" typically evokes direct or deliberate action to disadvantage one race, religion, or ethnicity. This kind of disparity is known as *disparate treatment*. However, more insidious form of discrimination can occur when ostensibly unbiased practices result in the – perhaps unconscious – unfair treatment of a socially disadvantaged group. This is known as *disparate impact*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disparate impact in a machine learning model comes bias in at least one of two sources: the data or the algorithm. A popular example is the prejudicially biased data used for recidivism prediction. Due to disparate socioeconomic factors and systemic racism in the United States, blacks have historically been (and are still) incarcerated at higher rates than whites.[[NAACP]](#naacp)  Not coincidentally, blacks are also exonerated due wrongful accusation at a considerably higher rate than whites. [[NAACP]](#naacp)  A recidivism model that fails to adjust for circumstances such as these will predict a higher rate of recidivism among blacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models can also be a source of disparate impact in their implementation, through unconscious human biases that affect the fair interpretation or use of the model's results. This tutorial does not cover measurement of fairness at implementation. However, if you are interested in fair implementationimplementation, we recommend looking at the [Fairness Indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/fairness_indicators) suite released by a team at Google.\n"

The baseline model will use only the patient's age, their diagnosis, and the use of medical procedures during their stay to predict this value. \n",

The long_los target is a binary variable indicating whether or not the length_of_stay for a given admission is greater than the mean. Observations have been dropped where LOS values are extremely long (30 days or greater) or negative (indicating that the patient was deceased upon arrival at the ICU). We will generate variable below, then generate our baseline model."

Males are assumed to be the privileged group. For the purposes of this experiment no other senstitive attributes or potential proxies will be used, such that only gender, age, diangosis, and procedure codes will be used to make the prediction.\n",

We will see that while some measures can be used to analyze a model in isolation, others (e.g. **Unawareness**) require comparison against other models to clearly demonstrate a model's fairness/unfairness."

    "The *Generalized Entropy (GE) Index* was proposed as a metric for income inequality ([Shorrocks 1980](#shorrocks_ref)), although it originated as a measure of redundancy in information theory. In 2018, [Speicher *et al*](#speicher2018_ref) proposed its use for Machine Learning models. These measures are dimensionless, and therefore are most useful in comparison relative to each other. Values closer to zero indicate greater fairness, and increasing values indicating decreased fairness.\n",

    "### Evaluating Significance: The Four-Fifths Rule \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the table above, the baseline model had slightly greater model performance, and by some measures indicate that this model has lesser disparity than the gender-inclusive model. However, the baseline model is also measured to have slightly **increased** disparity by other metrics. For example, the Statistical Parity Difference, Disparate Impact Ratio, and Average Odds Difference values are all slightly higher for the baseline model than for the GENDER_M-included model. How do we determine if this change is significant?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1978, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopted the \"Four-Fifths Rule\", a guideline stating that, \"A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded... as evidence of adverse impact.\" [EOC (1978)](#fourfifths_ref) This rubric has since been adopted for measures of fairness in machine learning. For example, applying this rule to ratio-based measures: since a ratio of **1** indicates a completely fair model, the \"fair\" range for ratio measures is $1 \\pm 0.2$ (or 0.8 to 1.2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Disparate Impact Ratios shown in the table above can be used as an example of this rule. A model whose Disparate Impact Ratio is 1 is considered to be perfectly \"fair\" relative to the protected attribute in question. Since neither model in this example has a Disparate Impact Ratio outside of the acceptable range, we can say that neither model imposes a significantly disparate impact with respect to gender according to **[Demographic Parity](#metric_quickref)**. Although, as will be clear in the next example, \"fairness\" by one measure does not necessarily mean that a model imposes no disparate impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of **[Individual Fairness](#metric_quickref)**, the Consistency Score for gender-inclusive model prediction is slightly less higher than that of the baseline model. This may indicate that the gender-inclusive model is able to discern gender-associated medical nuance, differing efficacy in gender-associated treatments. Hence, we can hypothesize that the gender-inclusive model is actually more consistent, although additional work will be needed to understand the care pattern prove and disprove the hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that since these measure values apply to only one split of these data, we have not yet accounted for the effect of randomness.\n"

Here we assume that individuals who speak English may be given preferential treatment in an English-speaking society due to the requirement of using a translator.

    "## Evaluating Justification\n",
    "The table above presents the measure values for the two LANG_ENGL-respective models. Although both models appear to be relatively fair by most group-fairness measures, by applying the four-fifths rule it is clear that the Disparate Impact Ratio of the LANG_ENGL-inclusive model shows evidence of disparate impact. Notice that this discrepancy is not clear from the Statistical Parity Difference, which is also a measure for the **Disparate Impact**. In this case the model \\\"favors\\\" the unprivileged class (those who do not speak English), which translates to a longer predicted LOS for those who do not speak English. Even the baseline model, although its Disparate Impact Ratio is within the four-fiths guideline, still shows evidence of some \\\"favortism\\\" toward the non-English speaking group. Does this constitute discrimination? As we noted [above](#disparateimpact), discrimination exists where differential treatment is unjustified.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the distribution figures [above](#engldist), there *is* a slight difference in the mean values of the English-speaking and non-English speaking groups. Because of this, we may be inclined to believe that the ICU in question could have difficulty in assessing non-English speaking patients due to important information being lost in translation. For the sake of this example, let's suppose that follow-up testing indicates that this difference in means is not statistically significant: we should not expect a significant difference in the probability of the positive class for either the English-speaking or the non-English speaking group. Hence, the bias induced by the inclusion of LANG_ENGL in our model is not reflective of a real phenomenon. In this case, because there is both evidence of disparate impact and a lack of statistical justification for including the feature, inclusion of LANG_ENGL in our model could be considered discriminatory. However, a lack of statistical justification is not necessary to conclude that the LANG_ENGL model is discriminatory. There could be a historical precedent of non-English speaking bias in the data that has since been addressed; or, LANG_ENGL may be esoterically related to certain diseases, such that it's inclusion makes the model more predictive through its interactions with other features. Neither of these rationale are likely still to be strong enough to justify the inclusion of LANG_ENGL without supporting medical or epidemiological evidence."

However, the FairLearn measures are defined such that their values are irrespective of which rate belongs to the privileged group. Through this definition, values are always in the range of 0 to 1, where 0 is perfectly fair for the parity difference and 1 is perfectly fair for the parity ratio. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This tutorial introduced multiple measures of ML fairness in the context of a healthcare model using Scikit-compatible APIs from the AIF360 and FairLearn Python libraries. It discussed the four-fifths rule for evaluating the significance of fairness measures, and demonstrated the value of comparing multiple measures against each other both for a single model and across multiple models. Through the tutorial you considered reasonable justification for the inclusion of protected attributes within a machine learning model. And finally, you saw the similarity between the APIs for AIF360 and FairLearn. The knowledge gained from this tutorial can be applied to better-understand the effects of unfairness-mitigating algorithms, many of which are available in AIF360 and FairLearn as shown in the [table below](#mitigation).\n",
