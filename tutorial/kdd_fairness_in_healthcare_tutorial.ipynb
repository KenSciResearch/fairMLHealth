    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial introduces methods and libraries for measuring fairness in machine learning models as as it relates to problems in healthcare. Through the tutorial you will first learn basic background, before generating a simple baseline model predicting Length of Stay (LOS) using data from the [MIMIC-III database](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/). This baseline model will be used as an example to understand common measures such as the *Disparate Impact Ratio* and *Consistency Scores*. You gain familiarity with the Scikit-Learn-compatible tools available in [AIF360](http://aif360.mybluemix.net/) and [FairLearn](https://fairlearn.github.io/), two of the most comprehensive and flexible Python libraries for measuring and addressing bias in machine learning models."

    "## What is a \"Fair\" Model\n",
    "In the context of this tutorial, a \"fair\" model is one that imposes no discrimination - the unjustified differential treatment of individuals based on their demographic status. [Romei and Ruggieri (2014)](#romei2014_ref) We refer to these \"socially salient\" groups ([Speicher 2018](#speicher2018_ref)) as ***protected attributes***, aka. *sensitive attributes* or *protected features*. There are six common metrics for determining whether a given machine learning model meets this definition: Equal Treatment (\"Unawareness\"), Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Predictive Parity, Individual Fairness, and Counterfactual Fairness. Basic definitions for each of these metrics are provided for you in the [Quick Reference](#metric_quickref) below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Disparate Treatment vs Disparate Impact <a id=\"disparateimpact\"></a>\n",
    "Discussions of discrimination often evoke direct, typically deliberate action to disadvantage one race, religion, or ethnicity. Such explicit action is often referred to as *disparate treatment*. However, a more insidious form of discrimination emerges from ostensibly unbiased practices that result (often unwittingly) in the unfair treatment of a socially disadvantaged group. In machine learning models, such *disparate impact* can emerge, for example, from unconscious collection biases or undetected historical biases in the data. Disparate impact in machine learning can lead either to immediate disparity in model predictions or to a longer-term discrepancy through unconscious human biases in its application. This tutorial focuses on measures to detect the former. However, if you are interested in the latter, we reccomend looking at the [Fairness Indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/fairness_indicators) suite released by a team at Google.\n"

    "|**Equalized Odds**| Odds are equalized if $P(+)$ is approximately the same for all protected attribute groups.<br>  **Equal Opportunity** is a special case of equalized odds specifying that $$P(+ \\rvert y=1)$$ is approximately the same across groups. | Historical biases present in the data  are not addressed and may still bias the model. | [Hardt *et al* (2016)](#hardt2016_ref) |\n",

The long_los target is a binary variable indicating whether or not the length_of_stay for a given admission is greater than the mean. Observations have been dropped where LOS values are extremely long (30 days or greater) or negative (indicating that the patient was deceased upon arrival at the ICU). We will generate variable below, then generate our baseline model."

    "Our first experiment will test the effect of including the protected attribute 'GENDER_M'. This attribute is encoded in our data as a boolean attribute, where 0=female and 1=male. Males are assumed to be the privileged group. For the purposes of this experiment no other senstitive attributes or potential proxies will be used, such that only gender, age, diangosis, and procedure codes will be used to make the prediction.\n",

We will see that while some measures can be used to analyze a model in isolation, others (e.g. **Unawareness**) require comparison against other models to clearly demonstrate a model's fairness/unfairness."

    "### Evaluating Significance: The Four-Fifths Rule \n",
    "As shown in the table above, the baseline model that excluded the GENDER_M feature had slightly greater performance to the gender-included version by some measures (for example ROC). It was even measured to have reduced disparity by some measures, although these differences are slight and may be an effect of randomness in the model. Moreover, the baseline model is also measured to have slightly increased disparity by other metrics. For example, the Statistical Parity Difference, Disparate Impact Ratio, and Average Odds Difference values are all slightly higher for the baseline model than for the GENDER_M-included model. How do we determine if this change is significant?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1978, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopted the \"four-fifths rule\", a guideline stating that, \"A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded... as evidence of adverse impact.\" [EOC (1978)](#fourfifths_ref) This rubric has since been adopted for measures of fairness in machine learning as well, although the group with the \"highest rate\" is considered to be the group with the \n",
    "\n",
    "The Disparate Impact Ratios shown in the table above can be used as an example of this rule. A model whose Disparate Impact Ratio is 1 is considered to be perfectly \"fair\" relative to the protected attribute in question. Since neither model in this example has a Disparate Impact Ratio greater than or equal to 1.2 (or <= 0.8), we can say that neither model imposes a significantly disparate impact with respect to gender *according to the **Demographic Parity** metric*. Although, as will be clear in the next example, \"fairness\" by one measure does not necessarily mean that a model imposes no disparate impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of **Individual Fairness**, the Consistency Score for gender-inclusive model prediction is slightly less fair than the ground truth. The same measure for the baseline model, while  still less fair than the ground truth, is relatively closer to the ground truth score than is the score for the gender-inclusive prediction. So, by that measure, our baseline model is slightly more fair at the individual level than the gender-inclusive one. However, notably, these are relative measures of individual fairness, which are not necessarily specific to the gender feature. "

    "## Evaluating Justification\n",
    "The table above presents the measure values for the two LANG_ENGL-respective models. Although both models appear to be relatively fair by most group-fairness measures, by applying the four-fifths rule it is clear that the Disparate Impact Ratio of the LANG_ENGL-inclusive model shows evidence of disparate impact. Notice that this discrepancy is not clear from the Statistical Parity Difference, which is also a measure for the **Disparate Impact**. In this case the model \"favors\" the unprivileged class (those who do not speak English), which translates to a longer predicted LOS for those who do not speak English. Even the baseline model, although its Disparate Impact Ratio is within the four-fiths guideline, still shows evidence of some \"favortism\" toward the non-English speaking group. Does this constitute discrimination? As we noted [above](#disparateimpact), discrimination exists where differential treatment is unjustified.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the distribution figures [above](#engldist), there *is* a slight difference in the mean values of the English-speaking and non-English speaking groups. Because of this, we may be inclined to believe that the ICU in question could have difficulty in assessing non-English speaking patients due to important information being lost in translation. However, the independent t-test ([above](#engldist)) shows that this difference in means is not statistically significant, so we should not expect a significant difference in the probability of the positive class for either the English-speaking or the non-English speaking group. Hence, the bias induced by the inclusion of LANG_ENGL in our model is not reflective of a real phenomenon. In this case, because there is both evidence of disparate impact and a lack of statistical justification for including the feature, inclusion of LANG_ENGL in our model could be considered discriminatory. However, a lack of statistical justification is not necessary to conclude that the LANG_ENGL model is discriminatory. There could be a historical precedent of non-English speaking bias in the data that has since been addressed; or, LANG_ENGL may be esoterically related to certain diseases, such that it's inclusion makes the model more predictive through its interactions with other features. Neither of these rationale are likely still to be strong enough to justify the inclusion of LANG_ENGL without supporting medical or epidemiological evidence.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This tutorial introduced multiple measures of ML fairness in the context of a healthcare model using Scikit-compatible APIs from the AIF360 and FairLearn Python libraries. It discussed the four-fifths rule for evaluating the significance of fairness measures, and demonstrated the value of comparing multiple measures against each other both for a single model and across multiple models. Through the tutorial you considered reasonable justification for the inclusion of protected attributes within a machine learning model. And finally, you saw the similarity between the APIs for AIF360 and FairLearn. The knowledge gained from this tutorial can be applied to better-understand the effects of unfairness-mitigating algorithms, many of which are available in AIF360 and FairLearn as shown in the [table below](#mitigation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper understanding of these metrics and measures of fairness, please see the KDD 2020 Tutorial on Fairness in Machine Learning for Healthcare. Other additional resources and tutorials are also listed [below](#additional_resources).\n"
