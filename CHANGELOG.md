## [0.1.17] - 2021-07-31
### Library Reorganization

- Major changes to the structure of the library intended to make it more intuitive:
    - fairMLHealth modules were renamed to clarify scope and purpose. This will facilitate adding new features in upcoming PRs:
        - **reports.py** is now named **measure.py**
        - **model_comparison** is now named **report.py**
        - utils.py is now split into stat_utils.py and __utils.py
            - __utils.py contains back-end functions for which validation is assumed to have been run
            - stat_utils.py contains supplemental functions that may be useful in statistical analysis or data munging
    - newly-renamed measure.py has also been reorganized so that functions are in alphabetical order and names are more intuitive. (this should have been a separate PR. apologies in advance).
    - load_mimic_data.py is now "__mimic_data.py"
    - the "tutorials_and_examples" folder has been renamed "examples_and_tutorials" so that it will be easier to find (e.g. seen adjacent to the "docs" folder)


## [0.1.16] - 2021-07-30
### Documentation Update

- Doctstings on public-facing functions given added detail components of the code.
- The "feature_table" function was moved into utils.py so that it can be used publicly.
## [0.1.15] - 2021-06-25
### Cohorting Feature
- Enables regression versions of analytical functions, with basic measures added for the regression version of bias analysis table.
- Adds tutorial, template, and example notebooks for regression features
- Improves management of significant figures as required to enable flagging of regression outputs

## [0.1.14] - 2021-06-25
### Cohorting Feature
- Adds cohorting wrapper which iterates to create separate analysis tables by group

## [0.1.13] - 2021-06-23
### Flagging Updates
- Add flagging functionality for stratified tables (bias analysis table, performance analysis table, data analysis table)
- Update flagging function s.t. it can be called as an argument in the model_comparison or bias analysis table functions

## [0.1.12] - 2021-06-17
### Stratified Table Updates
- data analysis table now accepts y as a data frame, enabling stratified analysis across multiple targets.
