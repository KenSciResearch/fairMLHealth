    "## Evaluating Your Own Model? Looking for a Template? \n",
    "**Please note: This notebook is intended as an introduction to and reference for evaluating the fairness of a set of machine learning models using FairMLHealth, and it is not designed to work with outside models.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using our [Template-BinaryClassificationAssessment](../templates/Template-BinaryClassificationAssessment.ipynb), which also has a useful example: [ Example-BinaryClassificationTemplate]( Example-BinaryClassificationTemplate.ipynb) if you are looking for a template into which you can insert existing models. \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "All machine learning models can be assumed to hold biases, just as all humans hold biases and as all humans fall ill at some point in their lives. The motivation that drives us to study and prevent the harm caused by human illness drives us to prevent the harm caused by innate biases. That means building models that provide fair representation for all demographics. This starts with measurement and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces concepts, methods, and libraries for measuring fairness in machine learning (ML) models as it relates to problems in healthcare. This is a revamped version of the tutorial presented at the [KDD 2020 Tutorial on Fairness in Machine Learning for Healthcare](../docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-Slides.pptx), the notebook for which can be found here: [/docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-TutorialNotebook.ipynb](../docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-TutorialNotebook.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 1](#part1) will frame the problem and introduce our hypothetical example predicting Length of Stay (LOS) based on a subset of the [MIMIC-III clinical database](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/). In [Part 2](#part2) this baseline model is used as an example to evaluate and discuss common metrics like *Disparate Impact*, *Equalized Odds*, and *Consistency Scores*. Then, [Part 4] compares the results of the baseline model to results for other modeling approaches: one \"unaware\" version, a \"fairness-aware\" version, and a third version simply using a different standard machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are abundant other publications covering the theoretical basis for fairness metrics, and many resources both online and academic covering the details of specific fairness measures (See [References (bottom)](#references) and [Additional Resources (bottom)](#additional_resources), or [Our Resources Page](../docs/Measures_QuickReference.md) for just a few). Many of these otherwise excellent references stop short of discussing  edge cases and the practical and philosophical considerations raised when evaluating real models for real customers. Here we attempt to bridge that gap.\n",

    "In issues of social justice, discrimination is the unjustified, differential treatment of individuals based on their sociodemographic status [[Romei and Ruggieri 2014]](#romei2014_ref).  A \"fair\" model is one that does not discriminate. The goal of our work is thus to evaluate whether our model makes similar or predictions for all socially salient groups, or whether any differences are ethically justified.\n",

    "Let's examine a model built for a hypothetical program providing early health and financial counseling to patients expected to experience a prolonged length of stay (LOS) in an ICU ward. The service is paid for by small donations from the community it serves. We have found that LOS for this program can be predicted with reasonable performance, and as contemporaries in the healthcare industry we would like to ensure that resources are distributed among our patients fairly. \n",

Our model produces a binary prediction indicating indicating whether or not the LOS for a given admission is greater than the mean. Observations have been dropped where LOS values are extremely large (30 days or greater) or negative (indicating that the patient was deceased upon arrival at the ICU).\n"

First we will train three new models: an \"unaware\" version of our XGBoost model (one that excludes the protected attribute LANGUAGE_ENGL), a fairness-aware Grid Search model constrained by demographic parity (available through [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn), and a basic Random Forest model using our baseline data.

    "The table shows that relative fairness or unfairness of our predictions differs across the available measures, while model performance remains similar. Looking at the second row for example, we can see that the three altered model predictions have reduced Disparate Impact Ratio relative to our baseline. However, surprisingly, the Fair GridSearch result has so dramatically shifted the results that the model is now *less* fair by that measure. While the baseline model has a 20% bias in favor of the *unprivileged* group, the fairness-aware model has nearly a 40% bias favoring the *privileged* group. Yet, using the Balanced Accuracy Difference as a second example, we can see that both the unaware model and the GridSearch model are less fair by this measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar results are not always the case. The GridSearch algorithm available in Fairlearn has been shown to be effective on some datasets ([Agarwal *et al.* (2019)](#Agarwal2019)). And unawareness does not always reduce Disparate Impact; in fact it can increase it, as we showed in the [KDD 2020 Tutorial](../docs/publications/KDD2020-FairnessInHealthcareML-TutorialNotebook.ipynb) which compared fairness relative to gender using this same general setup. This goes to say that the field has not yet found a panacea which can correct all fairness issues for every model.\n"

    "Although our newer model versions create predictions that are more fair by measure of Disparate Impact, by other measures such as the Balanced Accuracy Scores or Consistency Scores our baseline model predictions may actually be more fair. As discussed above, although two of the ratio measures (Disparate Impact Ratio and Equalized Odds Ratio) are outside of the \"fair\" range for our baseline predictions, the the acutal differences in the rates which those ratios are comparing are very small. Moreover, although the Consistency Score value is also outside of the fair range, we have shown that the measure may be invalid for this particular dataset. Additional work is needed to define and support a valid measure of similarity if we are to use this type of score. Thus, these results indicate that our model meets the minimum threshold for group fairness **according to the measures available and according to the groups that we've defined**. This is a good start.\n",

    "Clearly there is still room for improvement, particularly since we easily developed two other models that are generally farther within range and with comparable results. We will have to consult the values of our stakeholders to know if the tradeoffs of these two other models are worth the gains. Moreover, we should not stop simply with the english language. Although the larger group of \"non English speakers\" may get predictions within the fair range, it's still worth investigating whether there are other language subgroups for whom the model performance fails. And if there are any other proxy variables in the data we will want to investigate those as well. We also must evaluate fairness relative to other protected attributes, such as gender (see [Example 2](#example2) and age."

    "Just as data and model performance can drift over time, so too can prediction fairness. We recommend integrating fairness evaluation with your modeling pipeline as a form of continuous process improvement. By regularly evaluating multiple measures of fairness at once you can ensure that it continues to meet the expectations of the stakeholders.\n",
