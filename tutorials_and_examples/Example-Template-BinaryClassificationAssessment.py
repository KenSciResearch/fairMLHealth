# # Binary Classification Fairness Assesment Template - Example
#
# ## About
# This example is intended as a simple illustration for the use of the [Binary Classification Fairness Assessment Template](../templates/Template-BinaryClassificationAssessment.ipynb). It compares a Random Forest Classifier against fairness-aware alternative versions of that same classifier. For more information about the specific measures used, please see the [Measuring Fairness in Binary Classification Tutorial](../tutorials_and_examples/Tutorial-MeasuringFairnessInBinaryClassification.ipynb).
#
# In the interest of simplicity, only two fairness-aware algorithms are compared in this notebook. However, several other fairness-aware models were tested in during development. For a peek at that process, see [Supplemental - Models for Binary Classification Example](../tutorials_and_examples/Supplemental-ModelsForBinaryClassificationExample.ipynb).

# ## MIMIC-III
#
# This example uses a data subset from the [MIMIC-III clinical database](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/) to predict "length of stay" (LOS) value. For this example, LOS is total ICU time for a given hospital admission in patients 65 and above. The raw LOS value is then converted to a binary value specifying whether an admission's length of stay is greater than the sample mean.
#
# Note that the code below will automatically unzip and format all necessary data for these experiments from a raw download of MIMIC-III data (saving the formatted data in the same MIMIC folder). MIMIC-III is a freely available database, however all users must pass a quick human subjects certification course. If you would like to run this example on your own, [follow these steps to be granted access to MIMIC III](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/) and download the data.
#
#

# ## Data Subset
#
# Data are imported at the encounter level with all additional patient identification dropped. Boolean diagnosis and procedure features are categorized through the Clinical Classifications Software system ([HCUP](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp)). All features other than age are one-hot encoded and prefixed with their variable type (e.g. "GENDER_", "ETHNICITY_").

#

# ## FairLearn Models
#
# The [FairLearn](https://fairlearn.github.io/) package includes three [mitigation algorithms](https://fairlearn.github.io/user_guide/mitigation.html) designed to increase the fairness of an existing model relative to one of two user-specified fairness metrics. Both algorithms and metrics are listed in the cell below.
#
# For more information about the specifics of these fairness metrics, see also [Part 5 of the Measuring Fairness in Binary Classification Tutorial](../tutorials_and_examples/Tutorial-MeasuringFairnessInBinaryClassification.ipynb#part5).

# ### Fair ExponentiatedGradient
#
# FairLearn's ExponentiatedGradient is a wrapper that runs a constrained optimization using the Exponentiated Gradient approach on a binary classification model. It treats the prediction as a sequence of cost-sensitive classification problems, returning the solution with the smallest error (constrained by the metric of choice). This approach has been demonstrated to have minimal effect on model performance by some measures. [Agarwal2018](#Agarwal2018)
#
# This approach is applicable to sensitive attributes that are either categorical or binary/boolean. It can be used for classification problems only.
#
# Note: solutions are not guaranteed for this approach.

# ## Set the Required Variables
#
# * X (numpy array or similar pandas object): test data to be passed to the models to generate predictions. It's recommended that these be separate data from those used to train the model.
#
# * y (numpy array or similar pandas object): target data array corresponding to X. It is recommended that the target is not present in the test_data.
#
# * models (list or dict-like): the set of trained models to be evaluated. Note that the dictionary keys are assumed as model names. If a list-like object is passed, the function will set model names relative to their index (i.e. "model_0", "model_1", etc.)
#
# * protected_attr (numpy array or similar pandas object): protected attributes correspoinding to X, optionally also included in X. Note that values must currently be binary- or boolean-type.

# ## Comparison with the FairMLHealth Tool

# The FairMLHealth model comparison tool generates a table of fairness measures that can be used to quickly compare the fairness-performance tradeoff for a set of fairness-aware models.

# In[32]:

# Generate comparison table (returned as a pandas dataframe)

# Here we determine the indices for equal odds measures so that we can highlight according
#    to those indices later

                 'Equalized Odds Ratio']

equal_odds = comparison.loc[eotag, :].index

# Here we return the flagged table as a pandas styler so we can also highlight
#       measures of Equal Odds
# Note that the HTML wrapper around the *.render() method facilitates color rendering for
#     GitHub, and is not necessary to view the colors natively in jupyter
